# Beth-Stack E-Commerce demo

## Inspiration

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24)

## Description

Small web app built on [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/), [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/).

Just built out of interest into the possibility of writing modern applications with minimum client-side Javascript.

## TODO

- Add support for browsers with Javascript disabled.
- Separate Views and Controllers from Routers.
- Add support for Postgresql and MySQL.

## Instructions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bashk
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
